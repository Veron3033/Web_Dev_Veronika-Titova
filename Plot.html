    <h1>Plot of the movie</h1>
    <p>The film takes place in a post-apocalyptic, flooded world where humans seem to be gone, and nature is reclaiming the land. The main character is a black cat whose home is destroyed by rising waters. After the flood, the cat ends up on a boat and meets other animal companions: a capybara, a dog, a lemur, and a secretary bird. Together, they must survive and navigate this new flooded world, learning to trust one another, overcoming their differences, and forging bonds despite danger and uncertainty. </p>
